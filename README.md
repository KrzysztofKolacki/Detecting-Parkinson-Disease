# Detecting-Parkinson-Disease
Python Machine Learning Project – Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost


An XGBClassifier is used to build a model in this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost. The data is loaded, the features and labels are obtained, the features are scaled, then the dataset is split, an XGBClassifier is built, and then the accuracy of the model is calculated.
